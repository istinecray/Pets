        <p>Pets! is a virtual pet website. Users can own and name various types of unique species of pets, then feed them, play with them, and interact with other users in the virtual world.</p>
        <p>Users will be able to customize all profiles and posts, including but not limited to: the user profile, pet profiles, user forum signature, and store front. Each user will also get their own home page to customize to their liking.</p>
        <p>Customization is strongly encouraged! Users will be able to rate profiles on a 5 star rating scale, by whichever criteria the user deems fit. (Good rating for a cool pet, bad rating for a hard-to-use layout, etc.) Ratings can be disabled by the user.</p>
        <p>There will be lots of items to collect and worlds to explore.</p>
        <p>Users will be able to interact with one another in real time, by means of instant messaging or following one another in the activity feed. The Forum section will have dynamic and static lists of topics to discuss in public. As a user browses topics, they will be provided with a button to load new replies as soon as they are posted.</p>
        <p>The site will remain kid-friendly at all times, enforcing a ban upon offending users. There will be an appeal system put in place for those users who feel their accounts have been banned erroneously.</p>
        <p>1 account per user, 25 pets per account.</p>
